## Component Object Model (COM)

Microsoft's Component Object Model (COM) is a technology supporting program interoperability via reusable, exportable, and queryable _components_. 

At its most basic level, COM is a set of rules that allow C++ code to be exported and reused at a binary level - it allows distinct environments to interoperate.

### COM Development Support

Some of the technologies developed to support COM development include the following.

- Active Template Library (ATL)
- Windows Runtime C++ Template Library (WRL): a template library (as the name implies) designed to update and supplant ATL
- C++/CX: a distinct approach to supporting updated COM development via C++ language extensions rather than a library (like the WRL)
- C++/WinRT

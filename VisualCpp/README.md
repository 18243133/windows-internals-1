### Text Processing

Features of interest include:
- Use of the Windows concurrency runtime
- Use of memory-mapped IO over Windows filesystem APIs or standard C++ filestreams

### File Download

- The ease of use of the API provided by IE for file download requests from Visual C++
- Manual manipulation of the console screen buffer and console cursor position

### XML Parsing

Features of interest include:
- The basics of the native Windows XmlLite XML parsing library
- The generation of unique, temporary file paths

### Websockets

Features of interest include:
- Rapid prototyping with C# (in a project that is meant to celebrate Visual C++)
- RAII-handle wrappers for simplifying an otherwise disgusting cleanup process
- The verbosity of the WinHTTP API

### Cryptography

Features of interest include:
- Use of unique handles and traits classes to simplify provider and algorithm management
- Construction of helper functions to wrap the (typically verbose) CNG API
